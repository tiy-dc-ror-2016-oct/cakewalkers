# Cakewalkers

Welcome to Cakewalkers! During "Agency Week" at the Iron Yard, our class pretended to be a dev shop and worked with a "client" to create an app for their bakery.

The bakery had recently started working with a baking robot that could receive orders through an API and bake the orders on command. The "cakewalkers" then were supposed to see the orders in their queue and have the ability to mark them as "out for delivery" and "delivered." The Admin was supposed to have the ability change product listings (price, etc.) and see all past orders. Finally, clients were supposed to be able log in or proceed as guests and order baked goods.

Our team used github branching and pull requests for version control, and we reviewed each others changes before merging them in. We managed to divide up the work and complete it in time for our final "client meeting." The application was built with rails, and communicates with an API that our instructor shipped that would receive the orders and mimic the responses of the "baking robot." We published it live to Heroku here: https://cakewalkers.herokuapp.com/.

The credit card payment is linked to a stripe test account (no real money is being processed).
